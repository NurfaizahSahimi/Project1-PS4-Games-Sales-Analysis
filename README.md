## Data Preparation ##

1. Data Understanding

   The project begun by trying to understand the data set and gain much knowledge about data, the curiosity the data will satisfy, its content and its type.
   Exploration of the dataset is done when different queries are formed, to find the relationship between each column, and gain further insight regardings questions asked above.
   
2. Data Preparation

   During data preparation, we eliminate all row with null value for Publisher column since the row will become useless once the Publisher column is null. This process is also      known as data cleaning.
   
3. Deployment
   
   All deployment and working codes is nicely prepared in jupyter notebook. We also use jupyter notebook to output chart and graph for better visualization.
