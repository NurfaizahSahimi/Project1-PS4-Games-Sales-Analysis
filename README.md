## Project Motivation ##

As a dedicated console player, I have interest or need to know more about the game published for any console. When I came across this dataset on Kaggle, I have few questions in mind that require me to seek for answers. This drives me to complete this project. 

The motivation to complete this project is to provide answer based on data to these questions : 
- [ ] Publisher
  > Question 1 : Which publisher have publish most games for PS4 (based on genre) ?
  > 
  > Question 2 : What is the ranking for the publisher (based on total sales) ?
- [ ] Sales
  > Question 3Â : Which PS4 game's genre published the mostÂ ? And during which sales its selling like hot cakesÂ ?
  > 
- [ ] Games
  > Question 4 : Which genre game has been released the most in a single year?


## Library and Installation ##

I used python 3 to complete this project. The library and installation command used in this project are listed as below: 

Library           | Command Installation             | Description
-------------     | -------------                    | -------------
Numpy             | `pip3 install numpy`             | Python library used for working with arrays
Pandas            | `pip3 install pandas`            | Open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks
Matplotlib        | `pip3 install matplotlib`        | Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python 
Sklearn           | `pip3 install sklearn`           | Sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling 
Seaborn           | `pip3 install seaborn`           | Open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
Matplotlib-inline | `pip3 install matplotlib-inline` | %matplotlib inline is a magic command for IPython that allows you to add plots to the browser interface
Pandas_profiling  | `pip3 install pandas-profiling`  | Quick explarotary data analysis with few codes

## Data Preparation ##

1. Data Understanding

   The project begun by trying to understand the data set and gain much knowledge about data, the curiosity the data will satisfy, its content and its type.
   Exploration of the dataset is done when different queries are formed, to find the relationship between each column, and gain further insight regardings questions asked above.
   
2. Data Preparation

   During data preparation, I eliminate all row with null value for Publisher column since the row will become useless once the Publisher column is null. This process is also      known as data cleaning.
   
3. Data visualization

   Data visualization gives better idea on data representation. All deployment, visualization, and working codes is nicely prepared in jupyter notebook. I also use jupyter notebook to output chart and graph for better visualization. A blog post regarding    this analysis was published using [Medium](https://nurfaizahbtsahimi.medium.com/what-publisher-should-learn-from-ps4-games-sales-7eed5e38ce85 "Medium").
